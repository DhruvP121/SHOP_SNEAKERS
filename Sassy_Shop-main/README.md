Sassy Shop is an e-commerce demo website designed to exhibit my proficiency in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
It features a grid-based layout displaying a range of products. This project does not include any backend functionality or external API/database connections.
Its primary purpose was to showcase my ability to develop an aesthetically pleasing, modern, and user-friendly e-commerce design using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
